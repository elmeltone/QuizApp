Thinkful Quiz App

Thinkful Project Directions:

In the remaining three assignments in this lesson, you'll work on a single project: designing and coding an interactive quiz app from scratch. Like you did with your shopping list app in Unit 2, you'll tackle this assignment in three steps. First, in this assignment, you'll review the requirements for the app, and then you'll need to design and wireframe your app. Next you'll create a static version of the app, so you can focus on HTML and CSS. Finally, you'll write the JavaScript code you need to bring the app to life.

The minimum requirements are as follows:

Create an interactive quiz that: Requires the user to answer a number ( at least 5) of questions, one at a time Prevents the user from skipping questions Gives some way for the user to answer Compares the user answer, and the correct answer to determine a score When all the questions are answered, display the user score. Allow the user to start a new game. Use JavaScript objects to represent the questions. *Hint: You may want to store the question objects in an array
